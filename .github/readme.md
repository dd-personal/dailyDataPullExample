# cronUpload .yml walkthrough

This GitHub Action is designed to automate the process of pulling data from a source, processing it, and then uploading the results to an AWS S3 bucket. It is scheduled to run at 8:00 AM UTC every day, ensuring that data is regularly updated without manual intervention.

## Workflow Breakdown

1. **Checkout Repository**: The action checks out the current repository to access the latest version of the data processing script (`dataPull.py`), ensuring that any updates to the script are incorporated.
2. **Setup Python Environment**: Python 3.8 is set up for running the script, creating a consistent runtime environment.
3. **Install Dependencies**: The required Python packages are installed, setting the stage for the script to run without import errors or missing libraries.
4. **Run Script**: Executes `dataPull.py` with environment variables set for sensitive data, such as database and AWS credentials. This step is the core of the action, where data pulling, processing, and uploading take place.

## Security and Configuration

- Sensitive information (ClickHouse password, AWS access key ID, and AWS secret access key) is stored in GitHub secrets, a secure method for managing confidential data within GitHub Actions.
- These secrets are then passed as environment variables to the script, ensuring that the script has the necessary credentials to access external resources without hardcoding sensitive details.
